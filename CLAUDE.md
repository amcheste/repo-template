## About This Repo

<!-- TODO: describe what this project does -->

## Developer Preferences

### Editor
- Primary: Vim
- AI editor: Cursor

### Shell
- zsh, minimal prompt

### Git & GitHub Workflow
- **Branch model:** `main` = latest release. `develop` = integration branch.
- Always branch from `develop`, never commit directly
- PRs always target `develop`
- `main` is only updated via CLI merge (`git merge --no-ff origin/develop`) by `/publish-release` — **never via a GitHub PR**. GitHub's merge button squash-merges by default, dropping ancestry and causing conflicts on the next release.
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`

### Scripting Standards
- Shell scripts must pass `shellcheck`
- Use `set -euo pipefail`
- Scripts should be idempotent

## Brand

This repo descends from [`amcheste/repo-template`](https://github.com/amcheste/repo-template), which is brand-aligned with [`@amcheste/brand`](https://github.com/amcheste/alanchester-brand). Badge colors (Hunter Green `#1F4D3A`, Ink `#0B0B0C`) match the brand by default.

When generating prose, follow the brand voice rules at [`voice.md`](https://github.com/amcheste/alanchester-brand/blob/main/docs/voice.md): no em dashes in prose, calibrated hedges over weak ones, lowercase eyebrows, numerical specificity. Hunter green is reserved for data, pivots, and the δ; don't use it as decoration.

For deeper brand integration (palette adoption, mark embedding, full theming sweep), paste [`docs/theming-prompt.md`](https://github.com/amcheste/alanchester-brand/blob/main/docs/theming-prompt.md) from the brand repo into a Claude Code session in this repo.
